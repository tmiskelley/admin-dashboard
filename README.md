# Admin Dashboard
This repository is a mock admin dashboard I created to familiarize myself with CSS Grid layouts. While Grid was the focus of this project, the layout does use a hybrid between flexbox and grid to acheive it's final result.

With this project, I researched and explored a lot of styling options that Grid provides, and also picked up on a few flexbox tricks I didn't know about. The key take away's from this project was learning the grid layout properties (i.e. columns and rows), grid alignment properties, and fractional units for responsive design.
